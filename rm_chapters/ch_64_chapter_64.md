#### 64.1 Chip-specific STM information

#### 64.1.1 STM instances and configuration

This chip has up to three instances of STM, one for each Cortex-M7 core. The STM counter increments at the STM module clock
frequency divided by a pre-scaled value.

#### 64.2 Overview

STM supports commonly required system and application software timing functions. STM includes a 32-bit count-up timer and four
32-bit compare channels with a separate interrupt source for each channel. The timer is driven by the STM module clock divided
by an 8-bit prescale value (1 to 256).

System Timer Module (STM)

#### 64.2.2 Features

STM has the following features:
• One 32-bit count-up timer with an 8-bit prescaler
• Four 32-bit compare channels
• An independent interrupt source for each channel
• Ability to stop the timer in Debug mode

#### 64.3 Functional description

#### 64.3.1 Count-up timer

STM has one 32-bit count-up timer that serves as the time base for four compare channels. When enabled, the counter increments
at the module clock frequency divided by a prescaler value in the range from 1 to 256. When enabled in Normal mode, the timer
increments continuously. The counter rolls over at FFFF_FFFFh to 0000_0000h with no restrictions at this boundary.

#### 64.3.2 Compare channels

STM has four identical compare channels. Each channel includes a channel control register ( CCR n ), a channel interrupt register
( CCR n ), and a channel compare register ( CMP n ). When the channel is enabled and its channel compare value matches the timer
count, STM sets the channel interrupt flag and generates an IRQ on that channel.

#### 64.3.3 Behavior in different chip modes

STM supports the chip modes of operation as follows:
Chip mode STM behavior
Normal When the timer is enabled ( CR[TEN] = 1), the timer counts up continuously.
Debug If CR[FRZ] = 1, STM stops the timer. Otherwise, when the timer is enabled ( CR[TEN] = 1), the timer
counts up continuously.

#### 64.3.4 Clocking

This module has no clocking considerations.

#### 64.3.5 Interrupts

STM can generate a channel interrupt. For information, see:
• Compare channels
• Respond to compare channel events
• Channel Interrupt (CIR0 - CIR3)

#### 64.4 External signals

This module has no external signals.

#### 64.5 Initialization

This module does not require initialization.

#### 64.6 Application information

#### 64.6.1 Configure the timer

1. Set the initial timer count ( CNT[CNT] ).
2. Specify STM behavior in chip Debug mode ( CNT[FRZ] ).
3. Set the counter prescaler ( CR[CPS] ).
4. Start the timer ( CR[TEN] ).

#### 64.6.2 Configure the compare channels

For each compare channel:
1. Set the channel compare value ( CMP n [CMP] ).
2. Enable the compare channel ( CCR n [CEN] ).

#### 64.6.3 Respond to compare channel events

For each compare channel:
1. Check the channel interrupt flag ( CIR n [CIF] ).
2. If the channel interrupt flag is set, respond to the interrupt request.
3. When the channel interrupt has been handled, clear the channel interrupt flag ( CIR n [CIF] ).

#### 64.7 STM register descriptions

The STM programming model allows only 32-bit (word) accesses. An attempted reference using a different size or to a reserved
address generates a bus error termination.
