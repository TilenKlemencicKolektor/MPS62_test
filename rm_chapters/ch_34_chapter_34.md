# Security Overview

#### 34.1 Introduction

This chip has a comprehensive set of customer-configurable security features designed to protect code and data from
unauthorized access. The content of this section is for non-secure operation only. Contact your NXP representative for details if
you need secure operation.

#### 34.2 Security features

MCXE31:
[5]
• Exceeds the EVITA - full functionality and offers high performance for edge nodes applications.
• Bases its chip censorship on the life cycle model. Access to chip code and data becomes progressively more restricted as
the chip matures through a defined set of life cycle steps.
• Offers these memory security features:
— NVM censorship support
— Debug password protection
— OTP flash memory areas
• Supports a unique ID—The chip has a unique ID stored in an OTP flash memory area. Any core on the chip can read this
unique ID.
• Includes ELE_HSEB, which is a dedicated security system providing:
— A processor core
— Dedicated SRAM
— Symmetric Hardware Accelerator
— Asymmetric Hardware Accelerator
— True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
— Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)
— Exclusive access to secure areas of the chip's flash memory
— OTA : In Field Secure Code/Data updates
NOTE
Refer Security Reference Manual and Firmware Reference Manual for the details on OTA.
Also, ELE_HSEB runs NXP firmware independently from the main chip processor cores and can implement advanced
security and monitoring functions.
• Supports a secure debugger interface.
• Provides boot modes:
[5] EVITA was a European research project existing from 2008 to 2011. There is no standard or a specification to test
compliancy. However, ELE_HSEB meets the common expectations often described in the industry as EVITA Full and
exceeds them in these cases:
— ELE_HSEB supports up to AES -256 instead of AES-128
— ELE_HSEB supports up to ECC -521 instead of ECC-256
— ELE_HSEB supports SHA-2/Miyaguchi-Preneel instead of Whirlpool

Security Overview
— Trusted and secure boot support
— Handshake that supports BAF
• Monitors operating conditions to maximize tampering resistance.
• Includes basic debugger restrictions (on and off via censorship mode).
When ELE_HSEB detects a security failure, it moves the chip to a secure state. The chip secure states comply with the chip safe
states. You enter a safe state as reset when there are security errors leading to reset. Moreover, if the chip stays in Run mode
and the lifecycle moves to the IN_FIELD phase in reaction to errors, the safety application can continue running without glitches.
