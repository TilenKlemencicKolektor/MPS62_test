# Power-on Reset Watchdog (POR_WDG)

#### 33.1 Introduction

POR_WDG monitors the chip for stuck or hang scenarios when in reset and standby sequences. It generates a chip power-on-
reset event to recover the chip in case it remains stuck in reset or standby entry/exit duration for a pre-configured period of time.
POR_WDG consists of a watchdog counter with a configurable threshold. After the threshold is reached POR_WDG generates
a chip power-on-reset event.
SIRC clocks POR_WDG.

#### 33.2 Features

• Counter with four possible configurable threshold limits
• Associate register interfaces to capture the status of input signals
• Monitors reset, standby entry, and standby exit

#### 33.3 Configurations

POR_WDG is enabled by default out of reset to actively monitor the chip reset sequence with the default timeout threshold
duration. The POR_WDG configuration controls support provisions for enabling or disabling POR_WDG and the counter
threshold, as described in the following sections.

#### 33.3.1 Enable/disable configurations

By default POR_WDG is enabled for reset sequence monitoring, as well as standby entry/exit sequence monitoring for stuck
scenarios. The following table describes the controls to enable or disable POR_WDG operation.

Reset monitoring Enabled dcf_client_utest_misc[16]

Standby entry/exit monitoring Disabled DCM's DCMRWP1[8]
Enables or disables POR_WDG for standby entry/exit monitoring.
0: Enable
1: Disable
See the DCM chapter for details.

#### 33.3.2 Timeout configurations

POR_WDG supports four configurable counter threshold levels for its counter, as listed in the table below. The default POR_WDG
timeout is 25 ms.

#### 33.3.3 Event and status registers

POR_WDG provides indication of a POR_WDG event along with the status of the chip at the point when the POR_WDG
counter overflows.
POR_WDG event status register : A POR_WDG event is captured in DCM status register DCMROPP4[0].
POR_WDG status registers : The status of the chip at the POR_WDG event is captured in DCM status registers DCMROPP1–
DCMROPP3. See the DCM chapter for details.
DCM's DCMROPP n are reset on a POR caused by PMC and are unaffected by a POR_WDG reset.

#### 33.4 Reset sequence monitoring

#### 33.4.1 Introduction

At power-up POR_WDG is enabled for reset monitoring (DCF record in UTEST Misc can bypass POR_WDG, as described in
Table 184 ).
On every reset event, POR_WDG starts monitoring the reset sequence (including the functional reset entry sequence, in case of
functional reset event).
If the chip does not exit the reset sequence within the POR_WDG timeout threshold, then POR_WDG initiates a POR sequence
to recover the chip from a stuck or hung scenario. You can view the POR_WDG status in DCM's DCMROPPn registers to obtain:
• Diagnostic status
• Chip details in the event of a POR_WDG reset

#### 33.4.2 Inactive windows or bypass operation

POR_WDG monitoring of the reset sequence is inactive in the following conditions:
• POR_WDG is disabled for reset monitoring by chip configuration in UTEST via dcf_client_utest_misc[16]. See the DCF
clients file attached to this document for details.
• MC_RGM destructive reset escalation (ensures that the chip stays in reset).
• Extend pin reset by keeping it pressed externally.
• During selftest, when MC_RGM.RGM_ERCTRL[ERASSERT] is configured as 1.

#### 33.4.3 Windows of operation

POR_WDG monitors the reset sequence in the following scenarios:
• Reset pin is active (when chip is in reset, including the functional reset entry sequence).
• Standby domain functional reset is asserted (when reset pad is pulled up but functional reset is asserted).
• RUN domain destructive reset is asserted but flash memory is not in Low-Power mode (when RUN domain destructive reset
fires unexpectedly in Run mode).

• RUN domain functional reset is asserted but flash memory is not in Low-Power mode (when RUN domain functional reset
fires unexpectedly in RUN mode).

#### 33.5 Standby entry/exit sequence monitoring

#### 33.5.1 Introduction

On every low-power entry or exit event, POR_WDG starts monitoring the low-power sequence (standby entry and standby
exit sequence).
If the chip does not exit the standby entry or exit sequence within the POR_WDG timeout threshold, POR_WDG initiates a POR
sequence to recover the chip from the stuck or hung scenario. You can then check the POR_WDG status registers in DCM to check
the chip status when POR_WDG raised the POR to the chip.

#### 33.5.2 Inactive windows/bypass operation

You can configure DCM's DCMRWP1[8] to disable POR_WDG for standby entry and exit sequence monitoring.

#### 33.5.3 Windows of operation

POR_WDG monitors the standby sequence (standby entry and standby exit) in these scenarios:
• Standby entry sequence monitoring: Monitoring from main core WFI execution until PMC acknowledges Low-Power
mode entry.
• Standby exit sequence monitoring: Monitoring from wakeup event until the RUN domain reset recovery.
