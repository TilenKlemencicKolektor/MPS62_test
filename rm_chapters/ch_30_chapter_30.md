# Reset Overview

#### 30.1 Introduction

This chip's reset logic consists of a reset sequence that leads the chip to a fixed deterministic state after predefined reset events
occur. These events can pertain to chip failure events, the chip's special operating conditions, or certain software-governed events
to initiate a chip reset sequence. This chapter discusses the chip reset scheme and related topics such as:
• Types of reset reactions
• Reset event sources
• Chip reset sequences
— POR
— Destructive reset
— Functional reset
• RAM retention across functional reset
• Reset pin (RESET_b) behavior
• Debug system reset
• Signal-level reset flow

Reset event type Functional description
POR Leads to a complete chip reset.
Destructive Leads most parts of the chip, except a few modules, to reset. SRAM content is lost after this
reset event.
Functional Leads all the communication peripherals and cores to reset. The communication protocols' sanity
is not guaranteed and they are assumed to be reinitialized after reset. The SRAM content, and
the functionality of certain modules, is preserved across functional reset.

30.2.3.2 Chip action after reset event
For each reset event, immediately after MC_RGM captures it, the chip performs these actions:
1. Writes 1 to the corresponding reset event status fields in MC_RGM.DES and MC_RGM.FES (see the MC_RGM chapter
for more information).
2. Places its pins in their default states (see the IOMUX file attached to this document for more information).
3. Asserts the RESET_b pin.
NOTE
After self-test completes, you can configure RESET_b assertion using MC_RGM.FES[ST_DONE].
4. Enters the reset sequence as described in Reset event reactions , depending on the current state and reset event type.

#### 30.3 Reset sources—POR, destructive, and functional

MC_RGM records reset events in MC_RGM.FES and MC_RGM.DES, indicating the source of functional reset events and
destructive reset events, respectively. You must read these fields to identify the reset source on reset recovery.

#### 30.3.2 Stages of the POR sequence

Table 153. Stages of the POR sequence
Stage Process
PWRUP
1. Starts after a POR event (for example, a POR source assert).
2. Waits for the power-up sequence to complete.
3. Exits when all the POR sources clear.
4. Transitions to the FIRC_STRT stage after the procedure completes.
FIRC_STRT
1. Enters this stage after exiting the PWRUP stage.
NOTE
FIRC_CLK, if enabled, becomes available after it is stable. The duration
depends on the clock startup time (see the chip datasheet for more
information). The MC_RGM state machine proceeds further after
FIRC_CLK is available.
2. Transitions to the destructive reset sequence after the procedure completes.

Functional reset entry sequences
FUNC0
This stage starts after any functional reset event.
The FCCU fault monitoring and CMU_F x _ n monitoring for FLL events is masked in this step to avoid any
false fault or reset.
FUNC1
In this stage, a halt sequence that includes daisy chaining of all the gaskets halts, disabling the crossbar.
The stage completes after the halt-handshake sequence completes.
FUNC2
In this stage, MC_RGM triggers the MC_CGM hardware clock multiplexers to switch to FIRC_CLK.
• Software-based clock multiplexers do not support switching to FIRC_CLK on functional reset.
• If PCFS is enabled, the system clock switching can be done via PCFS.
This stage completes after MC_CGM switches the system clock to FIRC.
FUNC3
In this stage, MC_RGM triggers all the MC_CGM hardware-based clock multiplexers with PCFS enabled
or disabled to move their dividers to default values.

Stage Series of events
• Software-based clock multiplexers do not support this feature.
This stage completes after all the clock multiplexer dividers initialize to their corresponding default values.
FUNC4
In this stage, PLLDIG turns off synchronously.
The stage completes after PLLDIG turns off.
FUNC5
FXOSC_CLK switches off synchronously.
The FUNC4 and FUNC5 stages ensure that PLLDIG disables cleanly to ensure there are no glitches on
the PLLDIG clock because of reset.
The stage completes after FXOSC switches off.
FUNC6
In this stage, clocks of modules that are a part of LBIST and working on the destructive reset are enabled to
meet their synchronous reset requirements, if any. For the self-test logic, in self-test, the destructive reset
deasserts after this stage completes and after safe stating is removed.
NOTE
In the self-test sequence, the logic, which is a part of self-test (LBIST logic) resets when
self-test completes. All the parts of logic in self-test (POR, destructive, and functional
reset) reset after self-test completes whereas the rest of the chip undergoes a functional
reset sequence because of self-test completion (MC_RGM.FES[ST_DONE] = 1). See the
Safety Overview and STCU2 chapters for more information on the self-test operation.
FUNC7
MC_RGM asserts the functional reset and triggers a counter running on FIRC_CLK (for up to 64 cycles)
to enable clocks for the modules having synchronous reset requirements.
Flash memory comes out of reset after this stage completes.
NOTE
The flash memory resets after a functional reset event but comes out of reset, before the
rest of the modules do, at the start of the functional reset exit sequence. The rest of the
modules reset when the functional reset comes out of reset at the end of the functional
reset exit sequence. Therefore, the reset to flash memory is an early functional reset that
deasserts earlier than the functional reset, even if asserted at the same time.
Functional reset exit sequences
FUNC8
This stage consists of flash memory and MC_RGM handshaking.
Flash memory indicates the completion of its initialization to MC_RGM.
FUNC9
DCM initiates the scanning of flash memory DCF records.
This state completes after the flash memory scanning completes. See the DCF clients file attached to this
document for more information.
FUNC10
After DCM scans the DCF records from the flash memory, DCM initiates the trim loading sequence for
analog blocks.
The analog blocks are loaded with the configured trimmed values in this stage, which completes after a
trim-loading sequence completes.

Stage Series of events
FUNC11
In this stage, MG_RGM stops driving RESET_b and checks that the signal does not assert externally.
If you enable low-power debug, MC_RGM waits for a debug acknowledge.
The completion of this stage indicates that MC_RGM completed the reset sequence, deasserting the
functional reset to the system.

#### 30.4 Reset and boot sequence

The chip reset sequence consists of several reset stages based on the occurrence of a particular reset event. All reset events
follow the same chip reset sequence; only the entry points vary depending on the type of reset event. MC_RGM triggers each stage
after the previous stage completes. These stages execute in a specific order, which ensures a deterministic state of the chip when
a reset event completes.
Figure 117 shows a high-level representation of the chip startup sequence.

#### 30.4.1 POR

This stage starts when the POR event occurs, that is, when a POR source asserts. The logic within the Run power domain running
on POR also resets in the chip Standby entry sequence.

30.4.2.2 Destructive reset event bypass
This chip supports a destructive reset event demotion mechanism that the application software configures. The destructive reset
bypasses and an interrupt event occurs (demotion). Table 159 discusses details related to GPR configuration and corresponding
interrupt identification.
A successful chip operation is not guranteed if a destructive reset event is bypassed.

#### 30.4.3 Functional reset

The chip enters the functional reset sequence when any of the following events occur:

---

*Page 777*

Reset Overview
• Functional reset
• POR or destructive reset (after the DEST0 stage completion)
On any functional reset event, the chip starts a functional reset entry sequence before the functional reset asserts and ensures
the stability of logic running on a destructive reset and POR. On a destructive reset event or POR events the functional reset entry
sequence does not execute.
The functional reset exit sequence consists of steps that ensure proper initialization of the chip after functional reset recovery.
30.4.3.1 Functional reset sequence
Functional reset flow illustrates the functional reset flow and Functional reset sequence descriptions discusses the functional reset
stages and their descriptions.
Stages FUNC0 to FUNC6 present the functional reset entry sequence. It occurs on any functional reset event before the functional
reset. In other words, when a functional reset event occurs, MC_RGM holds the asserted reset and executes the functional reset
entry sequence. After the sequence completes, MC_RGM resets the chip, which remains in Run mode during the functional reset
entry sequence.
Stages FUNC7 to FUNC11 present the functional reset exit sequence, which occurs after a functional reset event before
deasserting the chip reset. This includes handshaking with the flash memory and analog blocks, ensuring correct operation after
reset exit.

30.4.3.2 FUNC9 and FUNC10 stage bypass for faster Standby mode exit
The chip supports optional bypassing of the FUNC9 and FUNC10 (only FIRC and PMC phases) stages on Standby mode exit
to considerably reduce the Standby mode exit duration. This feature is recommended only for Standby mode exit and must be
configured on:
• Standby mode entry sequence
• SW3
• Disabled on Standby mode exit
See the "Faster Standby recovery" section in the "Power Management" chapter for more information.
30.4.3.3 Standby reset sequence
The logic within Run domain is reset additionally apart from the reset sequence in the chip standby entry sequence, wherein all
the resets assert (POR, destructive, and functional) to the Run domain logic. The chip standby entry sequence does not have any
impact on the logic in Standby power domain.

---

*Page 779*

Reset Overview
Wake-up from Standby mode removes the resets to the Run domain in the standby entry sequence.
See the "Peripheral reset status" section in the "Reset Overview" chapter for the logic present in Run domain.
30.4.3.4 Reset function redirection
Resets may escalate or demote to an IRQ, depending on the chip configuration.
30.4.3.4.1 Functional reset demotion to an interrupt
This chip supports the reset sequence demotion feature for functional resets. You can configure a functional reset to create an
interrupt instead of a reset (see the MC_RGM chapter for details).
30.4.3.4.2 Reset escalation
The chip supports the reset escalation feature. If multiple functional or destructive resets occur, the related reset can escalate
to a higher priority reset sequence (see the "Functional reset escalation" and "Destructive reset escalation" sections in the
MC_RGM chapter).
30.4.3.4.2.1 Destructive reset escalation
You can enable destructive reset escalation by configuring a DCF client. You must also configure the destructive count threshold
in MC_RGM.DRET (see "Destructive Reset Escalation Enable Register (DEST_RST_ESC):dcf_client_dest_rst_esc" in the DCF
file attached to this document). The escalation event can individually be enabled or disabled for each reset source, and the fields
in the dcf_client_dest_rst_esc register correspond with the fields in MC_RGM.DES register.
After being configured, MC_RGM immediately asserts a destructive reset escalation when the destructive event count reaches
the threshold count in MC_RGM.DRET[DRET]. When the destructive and escalation reset assert, the reset sequence immediately
enters the DEST0 state. The reset sequencing remains in DEST0 until a POR event occurs. If enabled, the destructive reset
escalation counter increments with each destructive reset event. The application software clears the destructive reset escalation
counter by writing any value to MC_RGM.DRET[DRET].
NOTE
You can configure GPR settings to allow demotion of destructive resets to interrupts instead of escalation
(DCMRWP3[DEST_RST9_AS_IPI]). See Destructive reset event bypass for more information.

1. All the modules listed in this table are reset on a POR event. See the memory map file attached to this document for the
availability of modules across various parts in the MCXE31 family.
2. The modules in the RUN domain get reset on standby exit. The modules in STANDBY domain are not impacted by
standby exit and retain their contents. However in case of standby exit via functional reset or destructive reset event, the
corresponding flops within the STANDBY domain modules will also get reset.
3. The modules in the LBIST logic get reset on selftest completion.
4. Flash memory scanning logic is available in the Run domain. GPRs and LC decode logic are available in Standby domain.

Reset Overview
5. All memory-mapped registers are on functional reset. The trimming logic is on destructive reset. Rest of counter and other
stuff is on POR.
6. During functional reset stages FUNC2 and FUNC3 (see the Functional reset sequence descriptions for functional reset
stage descriptions), MC_CGM.MUX_ n _CSC and MC_CGM.MUX_ n _DIV_ m are automatically set to their default values.
The default value of the MC_CGM.MUX_ n _CSC[SELCTL] selects FIRC_CLK as the source clock for all multiplexers. The
default value of the MC_CGM.MUX_ n _DIV_ m is register instance specific (see the "MC_CGM register descriptions" section
in the Clock Generation Module (MC_CGM) chapter).
7. Only PIT_0 supports the RTI feature, and exists in the Standby domain.
8. The system domain is reset on functional reset. A POR will reset it completely.
9. PMC registers are reset on a destructive reset except PMC.LVSC, which is reset only by own PMC.LVSC[PORF] flag. The
LVR and POR logic is reset on an LVR or own PORF (see PMC.CONFIG and PMC.LVSC descriptions for details).
10. Reset on a functional reset; however, reset recovery occurs before the chip functional reset recovery, at the functional
reset exit sequence start, for proper trim scanning and loading.
11. SXOSC is reset on a destructive reset so that the RTC operates properly across a functional reset.
12. RTC operates during a functional reset.
13. The functional reset maps to nSYSRESET to Arm Cortex-M7 and the destructive reset maps to nPORESET to Arm
Cortex-M7. See the Cortex-M7 TRM for further description on part of logic on different domains within Cortex-M7.

#### 30.8 System RAM retention across functional reset

System RAM retains content during functional reset through the crossbar halt handshake. The system crossbar halts during the
functional reset entry sequence. Therefore, the accesses do not cause any content corruption (see Functional reset sequence for
more information).
Follow this sequence for the crossbar halt handshake (see Halt handshake using the daisy-chaining method for gasket locations):
1. Send a halt request to the ELE_HSEB AXBS, DMA AXBS, and EMAC IAHB bridges in parallel.
2. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from HSE_AXBS and DMA AXBS.
3. Send a halt request to the DMA IAHB and ELE_HSEB IAHB gaskets.
4. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from all the gaskets listed in the aforementioned steps.
5. Send a halt request to the system AXBS.
6. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from the system AXBS.
7. Send a halt request to a peripheral AXBS.
8. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from a peripheral AXBS.
9. Send a halt request to the TCM IAHB and QSPI IAHB gaskets.
10. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from all the gaskets listed in the aforementioned steps.
11. Send a halt request to the AIPS0 IAHB and AIPS1 IAHB gaskets.
12. Wait for a acknowledgement from all of the gaskets listed in the aforementioned steps.
13. Send a halt request to TCM AXBS.
14. Wait for a halt acknowledgement from TCM AXBS.
After this halt sequence completes, the crossbar halt acknowledgement sequence also completes and the chip proceeds to the
FUNC1 stage in the functional reset entry sequence.
NOTE
RAM retention is supported across the functional reset event for system RAMs only and not for ELE_HSEB or
peripheral memories.

#### 30.9 Pad state during reset and after reset

SIUL2 controls the GPIO functionality. It sets to its default state on a functional reset, and ensures that every pad initializes to its
default state (see the default configurations and reset states of the chip's GPIO in the IOMUX file attached to this document).

#### 30.10 Reset pin

This chip contains a bidirectional reset pin (RESET_b) indicating the reset state. RESET_b multiplexes with the other functions
on port PTA5 (see the IOMUX file attached to this document).
The DCF configuration controls the multiplexing capabilities of RESET_b. The default configuration of the RESET_b port is that of
a dedicated reset signal (for example, not multiplexed. See the DCF clients file attached to this document for more information).
The RESET_b pin offers the following uses if you configure it for the reset functionality:
• Acts as an external destructive reset source
• Acts as an indicator for the chip reset sequence for both functional and destructive reset sequences

---

*Page 785*

Reset Overview
NOTE
MC_RGM.FES[F_EXR] captures an externally sourced RESET_b assertion for a destructive reset.
The RESET_b pin also indicates an internally asserted reset to external modules. It has a weak internal pullup. In normal Run
mode, it keeps the chip out of reset.

#### 30.10.1 Reset pin control during self-test

You can write 1 to MC_RGM.ERCTRL[ERASSERT] to assert RESET_b (writes only in Supervisor mode), before LBIST or MBIST
executes. MC_RGM then asserts RESET_b and tristates the GPIO pins placing them in a safe state. Tristating GPIO ensures
a safe state for the chip pins when LBIST or MBIST executes. Following BIST, the chip executes a reset sequence. The chip
configures again for the application software, before executing the safety function. MC_RGM.ERCTRL[ERASSERT] clears on a
functional reset. See Figure 8 for an illustration.
NOTE
Writing 1 to SIUL2.MSCR n [SMC] enables the GPIO pins and the chip continues its normal I/O functionality.

Figure 123. Reset pin control before self-test
Multiple chip configuration scenarios cause RESET_b to react differently after self-test completion:
• You can write 1 to MC_RGM.ERCTRL[ERASSERT] causing RESET_b to assert. This assertion does not impact the reset
sequence, and the reset indicates that the chip is not available in Functional mode (although the chip is not in reset sequence).

• If MC_RGM.ERCTRL[ERASSERT] = 0 (the default value), the RESET_b pin goes low after self-test completes. After self-test,
the chip undergoes a functional reset in which the chip hardware writes 0 to MC_RGM.ERCTRL[ERASSERT]. The RESET_b
pin goes high after the reset deasserts.

#### 30.11 Application core debug from first instruction

The chip supports application core debug starting on the first instruction. This is supported on any functional reset and through a
RESET_b pin destructive reset for debug from destructive reset.

#### 30.11.1 Debug from first instruction on power-up or destructive reset onwards

1. When RESET_b is held low, the chip goes through a destructive reset sequence.
2. When you pull down the RESET_b pin, the chip goes through a destructive reset sequence, exits from the destructive reset,
and remains in functional reset, until the reset pin is released.
3. When the RESET_b pin remains pulled down, the debugger configures SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM70] and
SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM71] according to the requirements. To enable debug from first instruction, you
write 0 to these fields. To disable, you write 1. By default, the debug disables from the first instruction.
4. On releasing the reset pin, the chip exits from the functional reset sequence and ELE_HSEB starts executing.
5. The PORESETn deassertion occurs for the application cores simultaneously (in case of lockstep, Cortex-M7_1
PORESETn deasserts after a two-cycle delay). The corresponding core clock enable gates the deassertion of SYSRESETn
to cores. The SYSRESETn to the cores deasserts as follows.
6. On the basis of whether the debugger authentication is performed via challenge, response, or neither of them, you can
consider these scenarios:
a. Debugger not connected (DBG_PWRUP_REQ = 0):
i. BAF or FW writes to the clock enable control field in MC_ME for application cores, that is,
to MC_ME.PRTN0_CORE0_PCONF[CCE] for Cortex-M7_0, MC_ME.PRTN0_CORE1_PCONF[CCE] for
Cortex-M7_1, or both the fields as required.
ii. The clock enables in the subsequent clock cycle.
iii. SYSRESETn deasserts after ten clock cycles (adding eight clock cycles of delay ensures that reset always
deasserts when the clock is available; two cycle of reset deassertion delay). In case of lockstep, Cortex-M7_1
reset is delayed by two additional clock cycles.
b. Debugger connected (DBG_PWRUP_REQ = 1):

Reset Overview
i. BAF or FW writes to the clock enable control field in MC_ME for application cores, that is,
to MC_ME.PRTN0_CORE0_PCONF[CCE] for Cortex-M7_0,MC_ME.PRTN0_CORE1_PCONF[CCE] for
Cortex-M7_1 or to both the fields as required.
ii. The clock is enabled.
iii. The debugger waits for sometime (at least ten clock cycles) and then
writes 1 to SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM70] for Cortex-M7_0 and to
SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM71] for Cortex-M7_1 for releasing SYSRESETn of the
corresponding core.
iv. SYSRESETn deasserts after ten clock cycles (adding eight clock cycles of delay ensures that the reset always
deaserts when the clock is available; two cycle of RSL delay). In case of lockstep, the Cortex-M7_1 reset is
delayed by two additional clock cycles.
NOTE
Cortex-M7_1 is not available in MCXE315/MCXE316/MCXE317/MCXE31B.

#### 30.11.2 Debug from first instruction on functional reset onwards

If you enable debug, on functional reset, the debug connection is retained. That is because the complete debug infrastructure is
on destructive reset domain.

#### 30.11.3 Debug on standby exit by wake-up or functional reset

If you enable debug before standby entry, then the Standby domain stores the final status. The configuration for reset release is
reset (SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM70] and SDA_AP.SDAAPRSTCTRL[RSTRELTLCM71] the reset value of both
the fields is 1), which defaults to debug from the first instruction disabled.
You must configure the reset release on standby exit. It uses MC_RGM's low-power debug protocol before ungating the
reset deassertion.
